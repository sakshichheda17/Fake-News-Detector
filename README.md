# Fake-News-Detector
To build a model to accurately classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE.

This project aims at detecting whether a given piece of news is fake or real. We use sklearn to build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Next, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. Finally, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tells us about our model's performance.
